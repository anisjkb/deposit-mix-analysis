# 🏦 Gender-Based Account Mix Analysis in Retail Banking  

## 🎯 Project Objective  
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a retail bank's customer account distribution, focusing on the intersection of product type and gender. The goal is to:  
- **Identify patterns and disparities** in account ownership  
- **Enhance customer segmentation** for targeted strategies  
- **Optimize marketing** through data-driven insights  
- **Promote inclusive financial services** by addressing gender-based gaps

## 🧠 Methodology & Analytical Approach  

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and aggregation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Advanced data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis and reporting  

### 📊 Core Analytical Steps  
1. **Data Aggregation**  
   - Loaded `product_wise_ac_info.csv` and structured data by:  
     - Gender  
     - Product nature (e.g., "Low Cost," "No Cost")  
     - Product type (e.g., Savings, Current Accounts)  

2. **Gender Distribution Analysis**  
   - Established baseline proportions of male vs. female account holders  

3. **Product Engagement by Gender**  
   - Compared gender preferences across key deposit categories  

4. **Percentage-Based Segmentation**  
   - Normalized data to reveal relative engagement within each product type

## 🔎 Key Findings  

### 📌 Overall Gender Disparity  
- **Female customers dominate** in total accounts, particularly in **"Low Cost"** products (e.g., Savings, SSN-linked accounts).  
- **Male customers show higher engagement** in **"No Cost"** products (e.g., Current Accounts).  

### 💡 Behavioral Insights  
| **Product Type** | **Gender Dominance** | **Strategic Implication** |  
|------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|  
| **Low Cost**     | Female               | Strong alignment with savings needs; potential for loyalty programs |  
| **No Cost**      | Male                 | Opportunity to redesign features for female appeal (e.g., family banking tools) |

## 🚀 Strategic Opportunities  

### 🎯 Targeted Marketing  
- **For Men:** Promote "Low Cost" savings with goal-oriented messaging (e.g., "Save for big purchases").  
- **For Women:** Highlight utility of "No Cost" accounts with budgeting/family finance features.  

### 🧩 Product Optimization  
- Introduce **flexible sub-accounts** in "No Cost" products for women managing household finances.  
- Add **automated savings tools** in "Low Cost" accounts to deepen female engagement.  

### 🏆 Retention & Loyalty  
- **Tiered rewards** for frequent savers (e.g., cashback on balances).  
- **Financial wellness programs** to strengthen trust and long-term engagement.
